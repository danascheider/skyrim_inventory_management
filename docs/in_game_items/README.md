# Non-Canonical In-Game Items

Skyrim Inventory Management uses [canonical models](/docs/canonical_models/README.md) to store information about in-game items and validate user input. Most canonical models have a corresponding non-canonical model. These models are scoped to games (i.e., `belongs_to :game`) and associated to the matching canonical model by a one-to-many relationship.

This documentation covers the scope and purpose of non-canonical in-game items, their associations, and specifics pertaining to particular models that require additional explanation.

# Levelled Weapons and Armour

Many weapons and armour items, including one staff (Miraak's), are levelled in Skyrim. Levelled items, which are indicated by the boolean `leveled` field (note the American spelling) on the corresponding canonical model, have different characteristics depending on the level of the player character when they are obtained (or when the location where they are found is entered). In Skyrim, levelled items are actually discrete objects that have their own item codes. The characteristics of items at different levels may be obfuscated to the player, making it difficult to simply include all of these distinct items in SIM. For instance, an item may have a description like, "Does additional damage to hostile mages", but the actual amount of additional damage is determined by level.

Levelled items are definitely viewed as an edge case in SIM, and handling of them is not really fully implemented. Instead, a levelled item is defined in SIM using the item code and characteristics of the item at the _median_ level. If there is no median level (e.g., if the item is levelled across an even number of level ranges), an arbitrary instance of the levelled item will be represented in SIM's data. All levelled items will, however, have the `leveled` field set to `true`.
